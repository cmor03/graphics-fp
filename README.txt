The Knight Riders

FP / Final Project - "Obama Chase"

This program is a game built in OpenGL. You can walk around a maze, collect points, avoid monsters, and collect Easter Eggs. It is essentially a 3D Pacman.

Run the program by clicking play. You can use WASD to move around, and W turns on the flashlight. You can use the mouse to move the character's view.

Ensure that you have specified you include location correctly in your CMakeLists.txt

No known bugs.

We used a CSV file, which must be square and contains 0 for points, 1 for walls, 2 for monsters, and 3 for something special...

Gavin - Implemented collision detection for walls, FPV, texturing (lots), helped with slender shader, bezier curve, player movement
Henry - Map generation, game mechanics (levels, overall design, dying, etc), ghost movement, slender shader, texturing, point/ghost collision,
Colton - Boilerplate code for level and world mechanics, skybox, bill boarding of the monsters, car with two animations
